heap is complete binary tree
:
binary tree is called which tree has atmost two children

complete binary tree: a complete binary tree every node should have two children except leave of binary start from left side ok 
it statifs heap property

max heap:

  always root have max value and children value less than root
  min heap :
   always root have min value and children value greater than root
if node is n in cbt(complete binary tree) then height is log(n);


max heap
node -i
parent(i)=i/2
left side: (2*i)
right: 2*i+1;
