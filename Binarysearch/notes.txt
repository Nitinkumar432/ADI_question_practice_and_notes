n Java, binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. 
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half. 
This process is repeated until the target value is found or the interval is empty.
